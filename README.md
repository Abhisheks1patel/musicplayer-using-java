Java Music App with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Welcome to the Java Music App repository! This application is a feature-rich music player developed in Java, leveraging the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for a modular and maintainable codebase. With a strong emphasis on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, the app is designed to provide a seamless and extensible user experience.

Features:
Modular Design: The application follows a modular design, allowing for easy integration of new features and functionalities. Each component is encapsulated, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Inheritance: Inheritance is employed to establish a hierarchy of classes, promoting code reuse and enhancing the overall structure of the program. This enables the addition of new music-related features in a structured manner.

Polymorphism: The use of polymorphism enhances the flexibility of the codebase, enabling the application to adapt dynamically to different types of music and user interactions. This results in a versatile music player capable of handling various scenarios.

Abstraction: Through abstraction, the complexity of music processing is hidden behind well-defined interfaces, making it easier to understand and extend the functionality of the application. This contributes to a clean and intuitive user interface.

Getting Started:
To get started with the Java Music App, simply clone the repository and follow the installation instructions in the provided documentation. Explore the codebase to gain insights into the implementation of OOP principles and discover opportunities for further enhancements.

Feel free to contribute to the project by adding new features, fixing bugs, or suggesting improvements. Your collaboration is highly valued, and together, we can make this Java Music App even more robust and user-friendly. Enjoy the music experience!
